TODO

- change to node/express
- use $DATABASE_NAME and $DATABASE_PASSWORD everywhere in ./server
- replace all remaining references to xxxxxxxx with environment variables
- replace PORT 2053 with 443 everywhere
- confirm that process.env gets actual environment variables, not just ones in .env (i.e. PORT)
